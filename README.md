Analysis of two programming assignments:
Compromise search is a search algorithm that uses binary search until a certain threshold when it switches to linear search.
LogNVector is a vector-like data structure that is created using a vector of arrays with each array twice the size of the previous. This decreases the need for copying compared to std::vector.

Actual files for compromise_search.h and log_n_vector.h are redacted because they are solutions to homework assignments.
